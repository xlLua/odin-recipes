    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A Roman pasta dish made with simple but high-quality ingredients. It traditionally consists of spaghetti (or other pasta shapes like rigatoni or fettuccine) tossed with a sauce made from egg yolks, Pecorino Romano cheese, guanciale (cured pork jowl), and black pepper. The heat of the pasta cooks the egg yolks to create a creamy sauce without using cream.</p>   
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Spaghetti (or other pasta shapes)</li>
        <li>Guanciale (cured pork jowl), cut into cubes or strips</li>
        <li>Egg yolks (ensure they are fresh)</li>
        <li>Pecorino Romano cheese (finely grated)</li>
        <li>Black pepper (freshly ground is essential)</li>
        <li>Salt (use sparingly, as guanciale and Pecorino are salty)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Prepare the Guanciale</li>
        <ol>
            <li>Cut the guanciale into small cubes or strips (about 1/2 to 1 cm).</li>
            <li>Add the guanciale to a cold or medium-hot pan (a cast iron or heavy-bottomed pan is good).</li>
            <li>Cook over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, until the guanciale is crispy and has rendered its fat. This can take 10-15 minutes. The key is to render the fat slowly without burning the guanciale.</li>
            <li>Remove the crispy guanciale from the pan with a slotted spoon and set aside on a plate. Keep the rendered fat in the pan.</li>
        </ol>
        <li>Cook the Pasta</li>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of water to a rolling boil. Add a little salt (remember the guanciale and Pecorino are salty).</li>
            <li>Add the spaghetti and cook according to package instructions until al dente (firm to the bite).</li>
        </ol>
        <li>Prepare the Egg and Cheese Mixture</li>
        <ol>
            <li>While the pasta is cooking, whisk together the egg yolks and about half of the grated Pecorino Romano cheese in a bowl until smooth.</li>
            <li>Add a generous amount of freshly ground black pepper to the mixture.</li>
        </ol>
        <li>Combine and Form the Sauce</li>
        <ol>
            <li>Just before the pasta is ready, reserve about 1/2 to 1 cup of the starchy pasta water.</li>
            <li>Drain the pasta thoroughly.</li>
            <li>Immediately add the hot, drained pasta to the pan with the rendered guanciale fat. Toss to coat the pasta evenly.</li>
            <li>Remove the pan from the heat. This is crucial to prevent the eggs from scrambling.</li>
            <li>Quickly pour the egg and cheese mixture over the hot pasta.</li>
            <li>Add a splash of the reserved hot pasta water.</li>
            <li>Toss the pasta vigorously with tongs or a fork, continuously mixing, adding more pasta water a tablespoon at a time as needed, until a smooth, creamy sauce forms that coats the pasta. The heat of the pasta will cook the egg yolks without scrambling them.</li>
        </ol>
        <li>Finish and Serve</li>
        <ol>
            <li>Add most of the crispy guanciale back into the pan with the pasta and sauce. Toss to combine.</li>
            <li>Serve immediately. Top each portion with the remaining crispy guanciale, more grated Pecorino Romano cheese, and extra black pepper if desired.</li>            
        </ol>
</ul>
