    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A true icon of Italian cuisine. It's a simple yet perfect combination of flavors: San Marzano tomatoes, fresh mozzarella cheese, fresh basil, salt, and extra-virgin olive oil, all on a delicious pizza crust. Its origins are in Naples, and it's named after Queen Margherita of Savoy.</p>   
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>For the Dough (basic)</strong></li>
        <ul>
            <li>"00" flour (or all-purpose flour)</li>
            <li>Water</li>
            <li>Fresh yeast (or active dry yeast)</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>A pinch of sugar (optional, to help activate yeast)</li>
            <li>Extra-virgin olive oil (optional, for kneading)</li>
        </ul>
        <li><strong>For the Topping</strong></li>
        <ul>
            <li>San Marzano tomatoes (crushed or pureed)</li>
            <li>Fresh mozzarella cheese (sliced or torn)</li>
            <li>Fresh basil leaves</li>
            <li>Extra-virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Make the Dough</li>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, dissolve the yeast and sugar (if using) in the lukewarm water. Let sit for a few minutes until frothy.</li>
            <li>Add the flour and salt to the bowl. Mix with a wooden spoon or your hands until a shaggy dough forms.</li>
            <li>Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 10-15 minutes until smooth and elastic. You can add a little olive oil if it's too sticky.</li>
            <li>Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with plastic wrap or a damp cloth, and let rise in a warm place until doubled in size (about 1-2 hours, or longer in the refrigerator for better flavor development).</li>
        </ol>
        <li>Prepare the Sauce</li>
        <ol>
            <li>Drain the San Marzano tomatoes and crush them by hand into a bowl. Season with a little salt and a drizzle of olive oil. That's it! Simple is best.</li>
        </ol>
        <li>Prepare the Toppings</li>
        <ol>
            <li>Tear or slice the fresh mozzarella and let it drain on paper towels to remove excess moisture.</li>
            <li>Wash and dry the basil leaves.</li>
        </ol>
        <li>Preheat the Oven</li>
        <ol>
            <li>If you have a pizza stone or steel, place it in the oven on the top rack. Preheat your oven to the highest possible temperature (usually 220-250°C / 430-480°F or higher if your oven goes there) for at least 30 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
        <li>Shape and Top the Pizza</li>
        <ol>
            <li>Gently punch down the risen dough. Divide it into two equal portions.</li>
            <li>On a lightly floured surface (using semolina or extra flour), gently stretch or press one portion of dough into a rough circle, starting from the center and working outwards. Try not to press the edges too much to create a slight rim. Avoid using a rolling pin if possible.</li>
            <li>Carefully transfer the dough to a pizza peel or baking sheet dusted with semolina or flour.</li>
            <li>Spread a thin layer of the crushed tomato sauce over the dough, leaving the edges clear.</li>
            <li>Distribute pieces of mozzarella evenly over the sauce.</li>
            <li>Add a few basil leaves.</li>
            <li>Drizzle with a little extra-virgin olive oil.</li>            
        </ol>
        <li>Bake the Pizza</li>
        <ol>
            <li>Carefully slide the pizza onto the preheated pizza stone or baking sheet in the oven.</li>
            <li>Bake for 10-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is melted and bubbly.</li>
        </ol>
        <li>Finish and Serve</li>
        <ol>
            <li>Remove the pizza from the oven. Add a few fresh basil leaves immediately after baking.</li>
            <li>Slice and serve hot. Repeat with the second portion of dough.</li>            
        </ol>
</ul>
